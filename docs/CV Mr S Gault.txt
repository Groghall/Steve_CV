When I am not exercising or reading I try to spend as much time as possible with my wife and three children doing a whole range of family activities. I have a keen interest in general coding and have taken to teaching my sons basic web coding using HTML and CSS and have started learning PHP and SQL to gain an extra language to my current set.
